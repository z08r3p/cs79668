Brad loves Jeeps and he loves off-roading. Years ago, when his two boys were little, he would take a video camera to record the family camping trips they took together.   One day, he decided to post one on YouTube to see whether anyone would watch it. It turned out that people liked his video and so he started posting more. Eight years later, half a million people subscribe to his channel, TRAILRECON, to watch Brad and his family build vehicles, test equipment, and go on overlanding adventures in the   backcountry.
Along the way, Brad has been able to create a number of income streams: 
YouTube ad revenue: Brad earns money when viewers watch advertisements that play before, during and after his videos.
Sponsorships: because of his large following, vehicle accessory manufactures (for example, rooftop tents, recovery equipment etc.) will pay Brad to showcase their products in his videos.
Merchandising: Brad has created a website (trailrecon.com), to sell a number of products from various vehicle accessory manufacturers. Brad will receive a percentage of the profits from any of their products sold on his website.
Brad is also looking to create a new income stream by creating a TRAILRECON membership package. This package will allow members to receive weekly news and updates, to receive a discount on all products on the website, to view videos in advance of the general public, and to attend in person meetups and ride along tours. He currently has data on all of his viewers, sponsors and purchasers of his products in an Excel spreadsheet and hopes that he will be able to use this data to target people to become members.
This case is based on TRAILRECON and more information can be found on trailrecon.com
